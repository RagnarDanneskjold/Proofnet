Proofnet: A p2p broadcast network based on proof-of-work to prioritize messages.

Proofnet was introduced on the Bitcoin Forum. You can track progress here:
https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=31038.0

This implementation is written in Python 3.2.

The format for a Proofnet message is this:
(proof-of-work hash)(nonce)(utc timestamp)(channel hash)(message type hash)\
(message)

Where the types are this:
(sha256 hash)(64bit integer)(64bit integer)(sha256 hash)(sha256 hash)\
(any number of bytes)

Note that the proof-of-work hashes are big endian, and the 64bit integers are
little endian.
